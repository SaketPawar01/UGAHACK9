Explain purpose of project

# Bevy is your personal beverage specialist and uses computer vision and machine learning to help you select the best beverages according to your preferences.

Tools utilized

# We built Bevy using Python, Open CV, OpenAI, Figma, JSON, Dash, UPC Item Date DB.

Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them

# Being able read the barcodes on items was a struggle at first, however, once we found the appropriate API (UPC Item Date DB), we managed to read the back of them with relative ease. Another challenge we ran into was creating a formula that would accurately predict whether or not the user would like the selected beverage based on their preferences. After thinking for a bit, we came up with a great formula that would get user preference as close to suggested beverages as possible.
